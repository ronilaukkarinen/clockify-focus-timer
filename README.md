# Clockify focus timer

Was fond of [TickTick's](https://ticktick.com) full screen focus timer and wanted the same to [Clockify](https://clockify.me/), so I made this.

## Installation

1. Install [live-css-editor](https://github.com/webextensions/live-css-editor) (or any other extension that allows you to inject CSS into web pages) or use [Unite for macOS](https://www.bzgapps.com/unite)
2. Get style.css from this repo
3. Open extension and paste the CSS into the editor
4. Click ðŸ“Œ-icon so the styles will be remembered for the domain or if you want just to use it as needed, activate styles from the extension's popup
